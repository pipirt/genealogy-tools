# What
This a tool for making genealogical citations pretty. Copy a citation from [FamilySearch](http://familysearch.org/) or maybe [FindMyPast](http://findmypast.co.uk/) if they've got a sweet FindMyPast Friday going on, paste it into the box and let the beautification begin.

Then you can "linearize" some of the facts. Usually, these are the things like where the source is and how someone could go find the real book/piece of paper/whatever.

It also extracts URLs.

And now you know how I organize the sources in my genealogical file.
